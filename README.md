# bubble_level
2-dimensional bubble level implementing cascaded complementary filter for sensor fusion via ICM42688 and SSD1351 running on FreeRTOS on STM32

This implementation is part of my Bachelor's Thesis at University of Applied Sciences Technikum Vienna (Fachhochschule Technikum Wien) at the Department of Electronic Engineering.

It was developed with STM32CubeIDE.
SSD1351-library from https://github.com/Gecko05/SSD1351-Driver-Library commit 8538333 was modified within this project.
